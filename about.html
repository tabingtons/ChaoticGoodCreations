                            <p>
                                Hi, I’m Harry — the designer and developer behind Chaotic Good Creations. I help people and businesses who care deeply about what they do bring their ideas to life through thoughtful design and technology.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Founded on the belief that digital experiences can be both beautiful and meaningful, Chaotic Good Creations builds apps, websites, and systems that challenge convention — not for attention, but to create something genuinely useful, human, and good.
                            </p>

                            <h2>My Approach</h2>
                            <p>
                                Every project starts with curiosity and empathy. I take the time to understand your goals, your users, and what success truly means for you. From there, I design and develop with clear purpose — balancing creativity with structure so the result feels effortless to use and right for your brand.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I don’t chase trends or rush to deliver. I focus on building things that last — crafted with care, clean code, and a human touch. Because when technology feels considered and personal, people can sense it.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What I Build</h2>
                            <p>
                                I collaborate with individuals, startups, and small businesses who want more than just a digital presence — they want digital experiences that work beautifully and grow with them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                That includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Websites that are modern, intentional, and responsive — built on Wix Studio, Shopify, or custom code when needed.</li>
                                    <li>iOS apps that blend clean design with intuitive function</li>
                                    <li>Digital systems that streamline operations and make everyday work simpler.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />
                                No matter the project, the goal is the same: to create something that makes life a little better — for you and for the people who use it.
                            </p>

                            <h2>A Better Kind of Digital</h2>
                            <p>
                                Technology should feel human. That’s why Chaotic Good Creations exists — to bridge creativity and utility, to build things that matter, and to do it all with integrity and a touch of boldness.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Let's Create Something Good</h2>

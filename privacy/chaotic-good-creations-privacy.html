				<p>
					How we handle your information — clearly, securely, and
					respectfully.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>
					We only collect personal information that you choose to
					share with us, including:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Contact form submissions:</strong> If you send
						us a message through our website, we collect your name,
						email address, and any information you include in your
						message. These messages are sent directly to our email
						inbox via Formspree and are not stored in any online
						dashboard or database.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Booking information:</strong> When you schedule
						a meeting through Cal.com, your name, email, and
						appointment details are collected so we can confirm and
						manage your booking. Cal.com may store this information
						in accordance with their own
						<a href="https://cal.com/privacy" target="_blank"
							>Privacy Policy</a
						>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We do not use analytics tools, cookies, or any tracking
					technologies on this website.
				</p>

				<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					We use your information only for purposes directly related
					to your enquiry or booking, such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Responding to messages you send via our contact form.
					</li>
					<li>
						Managing and confirming discovery sessions booked
						through Cal.com.
					</li>
					<li>
						Following up on projects or services you’ve expressed
						interest in.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third
					parties for marketing purposes.
				</p>

				<h2>3. How We Store and Protect Your Data</h2>
				<p>
					Contact form submissions are delivered to our secure email
					account and not stored elsewhere. Booking information is
					handled by Cal.com, which uses secure servers and
					encryption. We take reasonable steps to protect all personal
					information against loss, unauthorised access, and misuse.
				</p>

				<h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
				<p>
					Under the <strong>New Zealand Privacy Act 2020</strong>, you
					have the right to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Request access to the personal information we hold about
						you.
					</li>
					<li>Ask us to correct or delete that information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To make a request, contact us at
					<a href="mailto:hello@chaoticgoodcreations.co"

					site:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Formspree (for contact form submissions)</li>

				</ul>
				<p>
					These providers have their own privacy policies that explain
					how they handle your data.

					We may update this policy from time to time. Any updates
					will be posted on this page with the revised date at the
					top.
